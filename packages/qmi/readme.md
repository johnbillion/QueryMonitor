# QMI

QMI is a composite package made up of React components which provide:

* Features for a developer tools UI
* Specific panels for Query Monitor

QMI is used for the main UI in the Query Monitor plugin for WordPress. While this package is still a work in progress, the aim is that the components are not coupled to WordPress. This means you can implement a UI for Query Monitor's collected data in an application separate from WordPress, for example a web browser extension or a centralised logging tool.

## Status

This is far from ready for real world usage. Follow progress at https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/pull/483.

## Installation

	npm install qmi
